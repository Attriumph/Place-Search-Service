# Place Search Service

## High-level Discription
Developed a webpage that allows users to search for places using the Google Places API and display the results on the same page 
below the form. Once the user clicks on a button to search for place details, the webpage will display several tabs which contain
an info table, photos of the place, map and route search form and reviews respectively. The webpage also supports adding places to
and removing places from favorites list and posting place info to Twitter.
